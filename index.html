<h1>Le Sequencer</h1>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>A simple sequencer written in javascript.
As a sequencer, what it primarly does is to convert the current ms into ticks and beats.
You are allowed (even encouraged) to register sequences that goes from a beat to an other beat.</p>
<p>Basically, it&#39;s only a singleton you could use as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a demo engine</li>
<li>a possible starting block for your own visually editable sequencer</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea came to me when I was thinking about a way to make javascript demos where visuals and sounds are processed 
through the same engine, to provide a purely synchronized experience between both worlds (remove the &quot;art&quot; from what I&#39;ve just said).</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t even google to see if anybody came up with the same idea; As a musician/music maker/composer/you-name-it, I came up with a pretty naive and straight-forward implementation of the concept that would actually make sense to me... hence the use of a BPM and TPB (&quot;tick per beat&quot;). </p>
<p>I guess it could also be a good starting block for a simple soundtracker in the end.</p>
<h2>HOWTO</h2>
<h3>Initialize it</h3>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Sequencer.init(options);</code></pre>
<p>Options are straight-forward so far.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">options = {
  debug : true|false, // will provide you a nice box for checking the current FPS and time, default is false
  bpm: number, // where the magic happens, what is your BPM of choice, default is 60
  tpb: number, // how much do you want to subdivide the BPM, default is 16
  loop: boolean|number // do you want the sequencer to loop? true actually sets it to 0-end, number is the beat you loop at default is false.
}</code></pre>
<h3>Make a scene!</h3>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var newScene = Sequencer.makeScene({
  start: number,  // start is a number, the beat you start the sequence at
  duration: number, // the beat you stop playing the sequence at
  values: {}, // an object for passing values you can reference on this (not sure it&#39;s useful)
  sync: [], // an array you fill with function and 
  init: function() {
    // a function that is executed when the sequence is initialized (when it starts playing)
  },
  teardown: function() {
    // a function that is executed when the sequence is removed (when it&#39;s done doing its job)
  },
  play: function(now, tick, beat, tickFired, beatFired) {
    /*
        that&#39;s where you do the magic cooking

        Arguments: 
          - now: time in ms
          - tick: time in tick
          - beat: time in beat
          - tickFire: boolean acting as a bang for &quot;new tick&quot;
          - beatFired: boolean acting as a bang for &quot;new beat&quot;
    */
  }
})</code></pre>
<h3>Register!</h3>
<p>There&#39;s two ways to register a scene.</p>
<h4>With an already created scene.</h4>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Sequencer.register(start, newScene)</code></pre>
<h4>Pass an object</h4>
<p>Passing a simple object is possible if you have no interests in doing &quot;weird&quot; things and you just want to register your scene without updating them later.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">Sequencer.register(start, {
  start: number,  // start is a number, the beat you start the sequence at
  duration: number, // the beat you stop playing the sequence at
  values: {}, // an object for passing values you can reference on this (not sure it&#39;s useful)
  sync: [], // an array you fill with function and 
  init: function() {
    // a function that is executed when the sequence is initialized (when it starts playing)
  },
  teardown: function() {
    // a function that is executed when the sequence is removed (when it&#39;s done doing its job)
  },
  play: function(now, tick, beat, tickFired, beatFired) {
    /*
        that&#39;s where you do the magic cooking

        Arguments: 
          - now: time in ms
          - tick: time in tick
          - beat: time in beat
          - tickFire: boolean acting as a bang for &quot;new tick&quot;
          - beatFired: boolean acting as a bang for &quot;new beat&quot;
    */
  }
})</code></pre>
<h3>PLAY IT!</h3>
<p>Because it&#39;s begging hard for being played. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">startTime = +(new Date)
Sequencer.play(0)
requestAnimationFrame(main)

function main(t) {
  requestAnimationFrame(main)
  Sequencer.play(+(new Date) - startTime)
}</code></pre>
<p>(The way you deal with your &quot;startTime&quot; value is actually yours :)</p>
<h4>SYNCS</h4>
<p>As you may have noticed, you can register an array of functions to play on every ticks, it&#39;s something you could easily do in the play handler of a sequence but I actually thought some person may want to externalize some bits of code. 
If you want to add a sequence of function to repetitively play, this is where you should register them.</p>
<p>Let say you set the TPB to 4 and you want to execute a sequence of 4 functions on every ticks.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">syncs: {
  arr: [func1, func2, func3, func4]
}</code></pre>
<p>let say there&#39;s only three of them with a silence?</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">syncs: {
  arr: [func1, func2, null, func3]
}</code></pre>
<p>And let say you decided to set a TPB of 32 and want to subdivide?</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">syncs: {
  arr: [func1, func2, func3, func4],
  sub: 4
}</code></pre>
<p>Then the functions of the array will be executed like this:
-&gt; 0: func1 
-&gt; 8: func2
-&gt; 16: func3
-&gt; 24: func4</p>
<p>TODO/Possible improvements: 
Randomize?</p>
<h3>Misc.</h3>
<p>While this sequencer was mainly built for making demos and synchronized animations, I realized some people may want to unregister and register scenes
while it&#39;s playing. It&#39;s now possible using Sequencer.unregister(sID) (where sID is the id property of a scene)</p>
<h4>Sequencer.init</h4>
<p>Function takes an object as a parameter, will extend the default options of the sequencer.</p>
<h4>Sequencer.makeScene</h4>
<p>Didn&#39;t we cover that already? </p>
<h4>Sequencer.register</h4>
<p>Ok, we&#39;ve been through that already :)</p>
<h4>Sequencer.unregister</h4>
<p>Completely remove traces of the scene. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function unregister(sID)</code></pre>
<h4>Sequencer.add</h4>
<p>Add a scene to the timeline. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function add(start, sID)</code></pre>
<p>WARNING: The scene must be registered first.</p>
<h4>Sequencer.remove</h4>
<p>Remove a scene to the timeline. </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function remove(start, sID)</code></pre>
<p>WARNING: The scene must be registered first.</p>
<h4>Sequencer.goTo</h4>
<p>Pretty self-explanatory, right?</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function goTo(beat)</code></pre>
<h4>Sequencer.play</h4>
<p>Play! Actually, it&#39;s just converting the passed ms value into beats and ticks and will find which scenes should be added to the playback</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function play(ms)</code></pre>
<h3>Final words</h3>
<p>I started this (and almost ended it) during my summer 2013 holidays.
I just had an idea while my daughter was sleeping and I thought I might eventually give it a try.
It&#39;s not perfect but it&#39;s working and it&#39;s begging for people to test and improve it (pretty please).</p>
<p>Big thanks to Nicolas Léveillé (aka <a href="https://github.com/uucidl">uucidl</a>) for giving me some good tips about how to start coding a sequencer... I actually started the wrong way and didn&#39;t consider it should just be a converter at first.</p>
<p>Greets to <a href="https://github.com/mog">mog</a> who actually found it worth sharing with others.</p>
